# Killer Kao!!!

## *GASP!* You have encountered a BEAR (ʕ•ᴥ• ʔ). What do you do?
* Fight it?
* Throw it?
* Block its hits?

## Gameplay:
* Player starts game by...pressing the big red "START" button in the middle
* Player chooses an action:
-- Strike
-- Throw
-- Block


## Game Logic:
* Player selects action-type!
This will randomy generate a number between 0-2

* IF the player generates a number greater than that of Bear, the player wins the round, thereby keeping their remaining Hit Points (HP).

* HOWEVER, if Bear wins, the player loses one hit point!
First player to zero HP loses!
