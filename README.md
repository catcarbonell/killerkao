# !!! Killer Kao !!!
### (๑و•̀ω•́)و < -- Fite me!) ( Rorrror? -- >  ʕ•ᴥ•  ʔ
* *Fun fact:* These emotes were derived from the infamous Japanese *"Kaomojis"*: 
the predecessor to Emojis! 
* "Kao" (顔 - KAH-oh -- like "cow" ) means "face" in Japanese!

## *GASP!* You have encountered a BEAR (ʕ•ᴥ• ʔ). What do you do?
* Fight it?
* Throw it?
* Block its hits?

## Gameplay:
* Player starts game by pressing the big red "START" button in the middle
* Player chooses an action from the buttons below:
  - Strike
  - Throw
  - Block
* Match goes on until Player and/or Bear loses all Health Points (HP)!


## Game Logic:
* Player selects action-type!
This will randomy generate a number between 0-2

* IF the player generates a number greater than that of Bear, the player wins the round, thereby keeping their remaining HP.

* HOWEVER, if Bear wins, the player loses one (or more) hit point(s)!

* First player to zero HP loses!

## Under the Hood
* This web browser application is made with HTML5, CSS3, [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), and vanilla JavaScript!
  * ...and &hearts;!
* The game utilizes a Random Number Generator. Good luck!
* The faces are stored in an object array, which is retrieved via document.eventListeners!
